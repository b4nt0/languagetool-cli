People love giving *strong* feedback in Ukraine. If you cut in front of someone in a line, you will be instantly yelled at - in the best case scenario. Same if you stand in someone's way, drive too fast, drive too slow, wait too long, or really do anything that someone else might dislike.

In Belgium people [don't](../disclaimer) do that. If you do "funny" / impolite / inappropriate things, people won't tell you anything. There will be no yelling, no cursing, even no tutting. You probably won't notice anything at all (I still don't know if it's expected that you give your place to an older person in public transport for example).

However if you seriously cross the line they will give you

# The Look.

Yes, you will be punished by being looked at. It won't be an angry look. Instead the eyes of the people looking at you will be filled with a mix of sadness and disappointment.

You have dishonoured yourself, there's nothing to be said or done now. It's time to lower your head, avert your eyes, and think about what you've done.

For minor crimes Belgian courts sentence the offenders to The Look. The sentence is carried out a special squad of old ladies and professional neighbors, who will Look at you for as long as it is required by the severity of the crime committed.

Honestly I love the fact that Belgians are not quick to judge, but no feedback made it harder to integrate :)
